# decibels_detection
Project written in C that gets inputs from an microphone and throws a notification via an LED when loudness is too high

Description:
The project was built using C(embedded into an arduino).
The main project components were:
  -An Arduino board
  -a microphone
  -an external LED
  
The main purpose of the program was to create a program to detect the volume of decibels inside a living room and alert when loudness exceeds a threshold(created using an Arduino board)
